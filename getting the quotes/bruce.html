<blockquote><p>Growth is the constant discovery and understanding in one&#8217;s process of living. <a class="clicktotweet" title="Click to tweet!" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Growth is the constant discovery and understanding in one's process of living.+http://bit.ly/BestBruceLeeQuotes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Click to tweet</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>While we are still alive, we have to discover ourselves, understand ourselves, and express ourselves.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The growth aim is to lose more and more your &#8220;mind&#8221; and come more to your sense. To be more and more in touch with yourself and the world, instead of only in touch with the fantasies, prejudices, etc.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Man is constantly growing, and when he is bound by a set pattern of ideas, or &#8220;way&#8221; of doing things, that&#8217;s when he stops growing.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Without frustration you will not discover that you might be able to do something on your own. We grow through conflict.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The function and duty of a human being, a &#8220;quality&#8221; human being, that is, is the sincere and honest development of potential and self-actualization.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The fact is that we live only on such a small percentage of our potential: you do not allow yourself to be totally yourself, society does not allow you to be totally yourself.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://wisdomquotes.com/health-quotes/">I really dig exercise</a>. When I&#8217;m jogging early in the morning, boy! It&#8217;s sure refreshing.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>There is no such word as &#8220;maturity&#8221;. Rather: maturing. Because when there is a maturity, there is a conclusion and a cessation. That&#8217;s &#8220;the end&#8221;. That&#8217;s when the coffin is closed.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Jogging is not only a form of exercise to me, it is also a form of relaxation. It is my own hour every morning when I can be alone with my thoughts.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m not a smoker because I don&#8217;t think putting smoke into your body is quite the thing to do. As for alcohol, I think it tastes awful. Don&#8217;t know why anyone should want to drink the stuff.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t drink nor smoke and those events are many times senseless.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I am improving and making new discoveries every day. If you don&#8217;t you are already crystallized and that&#8217;s it.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>All types of knowledge, ultimately mean self knowledge.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Education consists in cultivation of intelligence (not cunning, passing exams, etc.).</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Education: to discover but not merely to imitate.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Learning techniques without inward experiencing can only lead to superficiality.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I am constantly discovering, expanding, finding the cause of my ignorance, in martial art and especially in life. In short, to be real&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Learning is important but do not become its slave. Above all, do not harbor anything external and superfluous, the mind is the primary.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Like everyone else, you want to learn the way to win. But never to accept the way to lose. To accept defeat &#8211; to learn to die &#8211; is be liberated from it.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Part 1. I never believe in large organizations, with their domestic and foreign branches, affiliations, etc.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Part 2. To reach the masses, some sort of a system is required; as a result, the members are conditioned according to that system.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Part 3. I believe in teaching just a few, as it requires constant alert observations on each individual in order to establish a true, direct relationship.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>A <a href="https://wisdomquotes.com/children-quotes/">child</a> must be taught early that money is only a means, a type of usefulness, an implement. Like all instruments, it has certain purposes, but it will not do everything. One must learn how to use it, what it will do, but above all what it will not do.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Look for ways to raise the pupil&#8217;s mind above duality, to the absolute awareness which transcends it.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>But then, how important is school? I barely made passing grades while attending the University of Washington.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Bear in mind that I seek neither your approval nor to influence you. So do not make up your mind as to &#8220;this is this&#8221; or &#8220;that is that&#8221;. I will be more than satisfied if you begin to learn to investigate everything yourself from now on.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>What we are after is the root and not the branches. The root is real knowledge; the branches are surface knowledge. <a class="clicktotweet" title="Click to tweet!" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=What we are after is the root and not the branches.

<blockquote><p>Real knowledge breeds &#8220;body feel&#8221; and personal expression; surface knowledge breeds mechanical conditioning and imposing limitation and squelches creativity.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>What is the point of education if you in yourself are not intelligent? If you are not creative?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Knowledge is of the past; learning is in the present, a constant movement, in relationship with the outward things, without the past.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>To understand, surely, there must be a state of choiceless awareness in which there is no sense of comparison or condemnation, no waiting for further development on the thing we are talking about in order to agree or disagree &#8211; don&#8217;t start from a conclusion above all.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Part 1. Above all, a teacher does not depend on a method and drill systematic routines; instead, he studies each individual student and awakens him to explore himself, both internally and externally, and ultimately integrate himself with his being.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Part 2. Such teaching, which is really no teaching, requires a sensitive mind with great flexibility and is difficult to come by nowadays.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>A teacher, a good teacher that is, functions as a pointer to truth, but not a giver of truth. He employs a minimum of form to lead his student to the formless. Furthermore, he points out the importance of being able to enter a mold without being imprisoned by it, or to follow the principles without being bound by them.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>A teacher is never a giver of truth; he is a guide, a pointer to the truth that each student must find for himself.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>A good teacher protects his pupils from his own influence. It is easy to teach one to be skillful, but it is difficult to teach him his own attitude. Each moment during teaching requires a full alert and sensitive mind that is constantly adjusting and constantly changing.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Give recognition where it is due. Complements definitely stimulate more effort and desire to improve. Be generous with honest praising.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Learning is never cumulative, it is a movement of knowing which has no beginning and no end.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Fluidity is the way to an empty mind. You must free your ambitious mind and learn the art of dying.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The knowledge and skill you have achieved are after all meant to be &#8220;forgotten&#8221; so you can float in emptiness without obstruction and comfortably.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>When one wishes to expand, one must first contract. When one wishes to be strong, one must first be weak. When one wishes to take, one must first give. Everything in this world has the alternative of existence and nonexistence (positive and negative).</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The world is full of people who are determined to be somebody or give trouble. They want to get ahead to stand out. Such ambition has no use for a man of Tao, who rejects all forms of self-assertiveness and competition.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The law of non-interference with nature is a basic principle of Taoism [stating] that one should be in harmony with, not rebellion against, the fundamental laws of the universe.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Part 1. The Chinese conceived the entire universe as activated by two principles, the Yang and the Yin, the positive and the negative, and they considered that nothing that exists, either animate or so-called inanimate, does so except by virtue of the ceaseless interplay of these two forces.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Remember never to assert your self against nature; never be in frontal opposition to any problems, but to control it by swinging with it.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>All in all, the goal of my planning and doing is to find the true meaning of life &#8211; peace of mind. In order to achieve this peace of mind, the teaching of detachment of Taoism and Zen proved to be valuable.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Only sober moderation lasts, and that persists through all time. Only the midpart of anything is preserved because the pendulum of life must have balance, and the midpart is the balance.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Completeness, the now, is an absence of the conscious mind to strive to divide that which is indivisible.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>In Buddhism there is no place for using effort. Just be ordinary and nothing special. Eat your food, move your bowels, pass water, and when you&#8217;re tired go and lie down. The ignorant will laugh at me, but the wise will understand.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>In ordinary life wu-wei is expressed in &#8220;producing and rearing things without taking possession of them&#8221; and &#8220;doing work but not taking pride in it&#8221; &#8211; thus the natural &#8220;way&#8221; stands in complement to all artificial ways such as regulation, ceremonies, etc. This is the reason why the Taoists don&#8217;t like formalities and artificialities.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Concentration is the root of all the higher abilities in man.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Thoughts are things, in the sense that thought can be translated into its physical equivalent.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Sharpen the psychic power of seeing in order to act immediately in accordance with what it sees.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Drop and dissolve inner blockage. A conditioned mind is never a free mind. Wipe away and dissolve all its experience and be &#8220;born afresh&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The more and more you are aware, the more and more you shed from day to day what you have learned so that your mind is always fresh, uncontaminated by previous conditioning.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>There is nothing that will enable you to pursue your course in greater peace than the patient bearing of insult. Patience is not passive, on the contrary it is concentrated strength.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>When you are awake, you must be fully awake and conscious about everything. This is a wonderful exercise.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Suffering itself does less afflict the senses than the anticipation of suffering.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>A concentrated mind is not an attentive mind, but a mind that is in a state of awareness can concentrate. Awareness is never exclusive, it includes everything.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Concentration is a narrowing down of the mind &#8211; but we are concerned with the total process of living, and to concentrate exclusively on any particular aspect of life, belittles life.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>All thought is partial, is can never be total. Thought is the response of memory, and memory is always partial, because memory is the result of experience; so thought is the reaction of a mind which is conditioned by experience.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The mind must be wide open in order to function freely in thought. For a limited mind cannot think freely.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>To bring the mind into sharp focus and to make it alert so that it can immediately intuit truth, which is everywhere, the mind must be emancipated from old habits, prejudices, restrictive thought process, and even ordinary thought itself.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>To be on the alert means to be deadly serious; to be deadly serious means to be sincere to oneself, and it is sincerity that finally leads to the Way.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Sincere thought means thought of concentration (quiet awareness). The thought of a distracted mind cannot be sincere.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Mans&#8217;s mind and his behavior are one, his inner thought and outer expression cannot contradict each other. Therefore a man should set up his right principle, and this right mind (principle) will influence his action.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Don&#8217;t think &#8211; feel. Feeling exists here and now when not interrupted and dissected by ideas or concepts.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Just watch choicelessly and in the watching lies the wonder. It is not an ideal, an end to be desired. The watching is a state of &#8220;being&#8221; already, not a state of &#8220;becoming&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Anxiety is the gap between the &#8220;now&#8221; and the &#8220;then&#8221;. SO if you are in the &#8220;now&#8221;, you can&#8217;t be anxious, because your excitement flows immediately into ongoing spontaneous activity.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>One great cause of failure is lack on concentration.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>As for the future, that is a time and a place where every worthy ambition you posses is within your grasp.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>In a time when everything goes well, my mind is pampered with enjoyment, possessiveness, etc. Only in times of adversity, privation, or mishap, does my mind function and think properly of my state. This close examination of self strengthens my mind and leads me to understand and be understood.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Part 1. Here is natural instinct, and there is control. You are to combine the two in harmony. If you have one to the extreme you will be very unscientific; if you have another to the extreme, you become a mechanical man, no longer human being.</p></blockquote>

Bruce Lee+http://bit.ly/BestBruceLeeQuotes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Click to tweet</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Art must originate with an experience or feeling of the artist.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Art is the way of the Absolute and to the essence of human life &#8211; creative action, with sensitivity, that positive state of innocence.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Art is an expression of life and transcends both time and space.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>If you are in the now, you are creative.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>If you are in the now, you are inventive.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Art is the perfection of nature and life through the artist, who has supreme control of technique and is thereby liberated from it.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Artists in all fields must learn to observe choicelessly, to digest their observations, and to express them in their work.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Art lives where absolute freedom is, because where it is not, there can be no creativity &#8211; art has no ego rigidity.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>To strive actively to achieve some goal gives your life meaning and substance.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>What does self-willed mean? Hell, isn&#8217;t it knowing above all, that, indeed, one is the captain of one&#8217;s soul, the master of one&#8217;s life?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>A self-willed man has no other aim than his own growth. He values only one thing, the mysterious power in himself which bids him live and helps him to grow. His only living destiny is the silent, ungainsayable law in his own heart, which comfortable habits make it so hard to obey but which to the self-willed man is destiny and godhead.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Part 1. Whether it is the godhead or not, I feel this great force, this untapped power, this dynamic something within me.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Part 2. This feeling defies description, and there is no experience with which this feeling may be compared. It is something like a strong emotion mixed with faith, but a lot stronger.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ll not willingly offend, nor be easily offended.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>With adversity you are shocked to higher levels, much like a rain storm that is so violent, but yet afterwards all plant grows.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Recognizing the influence of my subconscious mind over my power of will, I shall take care to submit to it a clear and definite picture of my Major Purpose in life and all minor purposes leading to my major purpose, and I shall keep this picture constantly before my subconscious mind by repeating it daily.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you&#8217;ll never get it done. <a class="clicktotweet" title="Click to tweet!" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done.

<blockquote><p>I couldn&#8217;t go wrong because what I always like about myself is this stickability toward quality and the sincere desire to do it right.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>There is an awareness without choice, without any demand, an awareness in which there is no anxiety; and in that state of mind there is perception. It is the perception alone that will resolve all your problems.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Right now I can project my thoughts into the future. I can see ahead of me. I dream (remember that practical dreamers never quit). I may now own nothing but a little place down in a basement, but once my imagination has got up a full head of stream, I can see painted on a canvas on my mind a picture of a fine, big fix or six story Gung Fun Institute with branches all over the States&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I am not easily discouraged, readily visualize myself as overcoming obstacles, winning out over set backs, achieving &#8220;impossible&#8221; objectives.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I will play with my children and joke with my children, but business is business. When the subject is a serious one, you don&#8217;t go around trying to keep from hurting their feelings. You say what must be said and set the rules which must be set without worrying about whether they like it or not.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The way to bring back the dream is to relive the dream as if it were happening now.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Be proficient in your field as well as in harmony among fellow men.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="#toc">Go to table of contents</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them. <a class="clicktotweet" title="Click to tweet!" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them.

<blockquote><p>Remember my friend to enjoy your planning as well as your accomplishment, for life is too short for negative energy.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>What I detest most are dishonest people who talk more than they are capable of doing.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Joy and suffering are the fruit of right and wrong thinking. Suffering, especially, is mostly self-manufactured; we are never so happy or so unhappy as we suppose.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The Dominicans have the simplicity of a real human being; there is not so hypocrisy like in the big cities.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Aim at perfection in everything, though in most things it is unattainable; however, they who aim at it, and persevere, will come much nearer to it than those whose laziness and despondency make them give it up as unattainable.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Negativeness very often unknowingly creeps up upon us. It helps occasionally to stop all thoughts (the chattering of worries, anticipations, and so forth, in your head) and then once more refreshingly march bravely on.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Most people can talk without listening. Very few can listen without talking. It is very rare that people can talk and listen.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Realizing that my emotions are both positive and negative, I will form daily habits which will encourage the development of the positive emotions and aid me in converting the negative emotions into some form of useful action.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The important thing is that I am personally satisfied with my work. If it is a piece of junk, I will only regret it.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Part 1. There is fear and insecurity in pride, for when one aims at being highly esteemed, and having achieved such status, he is automatically involved in the fear of losing one&#8217;s status.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Part 2. Then protection of his status appears to be his most important need, and this creates anxiety.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Don&#8217;t be forecasting evil unless it is what you can guard against. Anxiety is good for nothing if we can&#8217;t turn it into a defense.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Sincere and serious learners are difficult to come by. Many of them are five minute enthusiasts, some of them come in with ill intentions, but unfortunately, most of them are second-hand artists; basically conformers.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>No accidents are so unlucky but that the wise may draw some advantage from them; nor are there any so lucky but that the foolish may turn them to their own prejudice.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>To realize that it&#8217;s just an inconvenience, that it is not a catastrophe, but just an unpleasantness, is part of coming into your own, part of waking up.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Are you doing to make your obstacles stepping stones to your dreams, or stumbling blocks because unknowingly you let negativeness, worries, fear, etc., take you over?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>When a man seeks your advice he generally wants your praise.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>If you think a thing is impossible, you&#8217;ll make it impossible. Pessimism blunts the tools you need to succeed.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="#toc">Go to table of contents</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Each man must seek out realization himself.

<blockquote><p>I will never prostitute myself in any way that I do what I don&#8217;t believe in.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Independent inquiry is needed in your search for truth, not dependence on anyone else&#8217;s view or a mere book.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The important thing for you is to be alert, to question, to find out, so that your own initiative may be awakened.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Those who distrust the life-giving force within them, or who have none, are driven to compensate through such substitutes as money.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://medium.com/personal-growth/bruce-lee-how-to-think-like-nobody-else-f01ea7804eba" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">When a man has confidence in himself</a>, when all he wants in the world is to live out his destiny in freedom and purity, he comes to regard all those vastly overestimated and far too costly possessions as mere accessories, pleasant perhaps to have and make use of, but never essential.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Part 1. We should devote ourselves to being self-sufficient and must not depend upon the external rating by others for our happiness.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Part 2. So it is true that the more we values things, the less we value our self. The more we depend upon others for esteem, the less we are self-sufficient.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>We realize that manipulation and control are not the ultimate joy of life &#8211; to become real, to learn to take a stand, to develop one&#8217;s center, to the support of our total personality, a release to spontaneity &#8211; yes, yes, yes!</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Since life is an ever-evolving process, one should flow in this process and discover how to actualize and expand oneself.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Success means doing something sincerely and whole-heartedly. <a class="clicktotweet" title="Click to tweet!" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Success means doing something sincerely and whole-heartedly.

<blockquote><p>Independent inquiry is needed in your search for truth, not dependence on anyone else&#8217;s view or a mere book.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>People have to grow by skillful frustrations, otherwise they have no incentive to develop their own means and ways of coping with the world.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Head toward self-expression and self-actualization and not just a means of mediocre functioning or repetitious drilling on a chosen pattern.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>My only sure reward is &#8220;in&#8221; my actions and not &#8220;from&#8221; them. The quality of my reward is in the depth of my response, the centralness of the part of me I act from.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>This world is very practical. You do more work, you get rewarded more; you do less work, you lose your rewards.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>When you are in the now, you can&#8217;t be anxious, because the excitement flows immediately into ongoing spontaneous activity.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Part 1. Oftentimes business people see not a human being but a product, a commodity. However, you, as a human being, have the right to be the best goddamn product that ever walked and work so hard that the business people have to listen to you.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Part 2. You have that personal obligation to yourself to make yourself the best product possible according to your own terms.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Part 3. Not the biggest or the most successful, but the best quality &#8211; with that achieved, comes everything else.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Action is a highroad to self-confidence and esteem. Where it is open, all energies flow toward it. It comes readily to most people, and its rewards are tangible.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The main thing is not to expend one&#8217;s powers prematurely in an attempt to obtain by force something for which the time is not yet ripe.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>In order to realize our true self we must be willing to live without being dependent upon the opinion of others. When we are completely self-sufficient we can have no fear of not being esteemed by others.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>One should do nothing that is not natural or spontaneous; the important thing is not to strain in any way.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Wait in the calm strength of patience &#8211; he that is strong should guard it with tenderness.</p></blockquote>

			<p>Maxime Lagacé started collecting quotes in 2004 after he lost his girlfriend in a car accident.</p>
			<p>In search of meaning, he dived in the self-improvement world, psychology and trail running. His goal was to understand his pain, his depression, his fears, his lack of motivation and inspiration.</p>
			<p>Books, blogs, quotes and nature became his guide.</p>
			<p>He finished his software engineering degree in 2007 at the École de Technologie Supérieure de Montréal. He also studied at the The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. A few years later, he started his first website to share his passion for quotes.</p>
			<p>Maxime is a father of two and also loves running. His best 5k is 17 minutes 41 seconds and his best marathon (42k) is in 3 hours 33 minutes 11 seconds (with 1800 meters of elevation gain).</p>
			<p>Other notable interests of Maxime are health (mental and physical), meditation, nutrition, bananas, human potential, education, learning, productivity and minimalism.</p>
